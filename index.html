							<h2>Our Story</h2>
							<p>Sheesh</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>He was a boy
								She was a girl
								Can I make it any more obvious?
								He was a punk
								She did ballet
								What more can I say?
								He wanted her
								She'd never tell 
								Secretly she wanted him as well
								But all of her friends
								Stuck up their nose
								They had a problem with his baggy clothes
								He was a skater boy
								She said, "See you later, boy"
								He wasn't good enough for her
								She had a pretty face
								But her head was up in space
								She needed to come back down to earth
								Five years from now
								She sits at home
								Feeding the baby, she's all alone
								She turns on TV
								Guess who she sees
								Skater boy rockin' up MTV
								She calls up her friends
								They already know
								And they've all got tickets to see his show
								She tags along
								And stands in the crowd
								Looks up at the man that she turned down
								He was a skater boy
								She said, "See you later, boy"
								He wasn't good enough for her
								Now he's a super star
								Slammin' on his guitar
								Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
								He was a skater boy
								She said, "See you later, boy"
								He wasn't good enough for her
								Now he's a super star
								Slammin' on his guitar
								Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
								Sorry, girl, but you missed out
								Well, tough, luck that boy's mine now
								We are more than just good friends
								This is how the story ends
								Too bad that you couldn't see
								See the man that boy could be
								There is more that meets the eye
								I see the soul that is inside
								He's just a boy
								And I'm just a girl
								Can I make it any more obvious?
								We are in love
								Haven't you heard
								How we rock each other's world
								I'm with the skater boy
								I said, "See you later, boy"
								I'll be back stage after the show
								I'll be at a studio
								Singing the song we wrote
								About a girl you used to know
								I'm with the skater boy
								I said, "See you later, boy"
								I'll be back stage after the show
								I'll be at a studio
								Singing the song we wrote
								About a girl you used to know</p>
