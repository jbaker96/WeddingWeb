							<h3>GETTING THERE</h3>
							
							<h2>Driving</h2>
                            <p>It is a beautiful drive in to town from the East or the West. Length of travel can vary. 
							Leave time for potential construction/forest fires/highway closures/global warming etc. and check <a href="https://drivebc.ca">DriveBC</a> before you leave.</p>
							<br>
							<h2>Flying</h2>
                            <p>Flights into Cranbrook and Calgary are available, both will include a subsequent drive into the valley. 
							Rental cars and carpooling with other guests are both options. There will be plenty of cars leaving from Calgary where we can try and find space for you. 
							There is also a landing strip in Invermere if you are aeronautically inclined. You will be flying into a fully serviced airstrip (CAA8) and we can arrange for someone to pick you up from there.</p>
							<br>
							<h2>Carpooling</h2>
                            <p>Feel free to reach out to us if you are in search of travel companions or have space available in your vehicle to offer to other guests.</p>
							<br>

							
							<h3>ACCOMMODATIONS</h3>
							
							<h2>AirBnB/VRBO</h2>
                            <p>There are countless cabins/townhouses/homes available for rent in the area if you are coming into town with a group to split costs.
							In general, a large portion of the wedding invitees will be staying in and around the surrounding communities of Baltac/Timber Ridge.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Hotel</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://copperpointresort.com">Copper Point Resort</a> has given our wedding group a 15% discount on all single bedroom and single suites.
							A single bedroom is much like your standard hotel room. The single suites are a one bedroom apartment with full kitchen and patio bbq set up.
							All guests will have full access to the pools, hot tubs, and sport courts the resort offers. Each room also has a couch and offers the ability for a cot/crib to be in the room as well for families.</p>
							<br>
							<h2>Camping/RV</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://www.ravensnestresport.com">Ravens Nest Resort</a> has cabins, RV, and tent sites available and is close to the cabin communities.</p>
							<br>


							<h3>THE EVENT</h3>

							<h2>Pets</h2>
                            <p>Furry friends are welcome to come and visit for the weekend but are not allowed on the wedding venue property.
							For those looking for a pet sitter during the day of the event, <a href="https://unleashedpetcare.com">Unleashed Pet Care</a> offers services.</p>
                            <br>
							<h2>Kids</h2>
                            <p>Munchkins are welcome to come and enjoy the weekend, however the ceremony and reception will be for adult guests only.
							Connect with us if you require baby sitting the night of the wedding.</p>
                            <br>
							<h2>Dress Code</h2>
                            <p>There is no strict dress code, just dress appropriately for the weather and venue.
							There will be a 1km walk up a gravel road between the ceremony and reception sites. Flat shoes are recommended (you will want them for dancing anyway!). 
							If you think you may require a lift from the ceremony to reception for any reason, please let us know so we can plan transportation accordingly.</p>
                            <br>
							<h2>Meals</h2>
                            <p>Our event will be catered by <a href="https://winderberry.ca">Winderberry Edibles Cafe</a>, who is a local organic farm.
							Every dish will have its dietary restrictions listed out and we hope to provide enough options to accomodate any dietary restrictions.
							If you have any specific concerns, feel free to contact us directly or through the RSVP form.</p>
                            <br>
							<h2>Drinks</h2>
                            <p>There will be some complimentary drinks provided, as well as a toonie bar to supplement the rest of the evening. A variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages will be available.
							</p>
                            <br>
							<h2>Safe Rides Home</h2>
                            <p>We recommend carpooling to the venue the day of the wedding. There is a designated parking area on the grounds for guests who have a designated driver.
							Taxi services are extremely limited in the valley, but there is <a href="https://columbiataxiservice.com">Columbia Taxi Service</a> (250) 342-5262 as needed.
							<a href="https://columbiavalleyconcierge.wordpress.com/188-2/events-tours/">Columbia Valley Concierge</a> is a service which will drive you and your car home. This service requires pre-booking.
							We are more than happy to organize a shuttle bus to take guests home if there is enough interest in this. Cost is estimated to be $15-$20/guest. The main drop off points would likely be Baltac/Timber Ridge/Copper Point resort.</p>
                            <br>
							<h2>Parking</h2>
                            <p>Parking is available on site, however cars must be off the premises by 1am the night of the wedding.
							There is a specific patch of grass dedicated to parking, please follow the signs while on site.</p>
                            <br>
							<h2>Gifts</h2>
                            <p>This is a "destination wedding" for most guests, with many traveling great distances to be in attendance. Your presence is the best gift we could ask for. Anything above that is very appreciated but not necessary.</p>
                            <br>
							<h2>RSVP</h2>
                            <p>When RSVPing, please only respond for the persons listed on the save the date you received.
							If we missed a plus one that you would like to be in attendance, please message us and we will see what we can do.
							We fully believe the more the merrier, however our venue does have a capacity limit that we must adhere to.
							There will be no formal paper “invites” being sent out. Those that RSVP will get an electronic reminder closer to the wedding, so please ensure the email you provide is valid if you want updates.
							We can not wait to share our special day with you!</p>
